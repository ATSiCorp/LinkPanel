Before you can use LinkPanel, please make sure your server fulfils these requirements:

- Debian 10-12 & Ubuntu 20.04-24.04 x86_64 LTS (Fresh installation)
- If the server is virtual (VPS), OpenVZ may not be supported
- We are checking LinkPanel compatibility within Rhel / Oracle / ARM (not supported yet, I'm curently working)

Hardware Requirement: More than 1GB of HD / At least 1 core processor / 512MB minimum RAM / At least 1 public IP  Address (IPv6 and NAT VPS are not supported) / For VPS providers such as VPS, those providers already include an external firewall for your VPS. Please open port 22, 80 and 443 to install LinkPanel.

Installation may take up to about 30 minutes which may also depend on your server's internet speed. After the installation is completed, you are ready to use LinkPanel to manage your servers.

To correctly manage remote servers LinkPanel has to be on a public IP address (IPv4). Do not use it in localhost!
